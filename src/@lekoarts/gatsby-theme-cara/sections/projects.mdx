  Donkeys are the most underrated animals by sapiens, they have done a significant contribution in human history, anthropology and dominance not because they are cute but because they get the shit done with low maintenance and  reliability. In Fact  they have greater intelligence, a firm sense of self preservation, and independence than horses and dogs. They have been favourite animals for masses who didn't have the time nor the will to go out and comb their donkeys. They needed an animal that could get up in the morning and work. Plus they can work up to old age and they live longer than horses. 
That is what we are expecting from DONGE simple non flashy token that get the things done

  The knowledge revolution in 1400 with printing press, 1800s Power revolution by steam engine and the computer and internet revolution from 1900 have revolutionised our world which was not a simple flow. Lots of trial and error, educating and evangelisation. The Internet was a fad and myth in the past like most see blockchain even now. After the Dot-com bubble of the 1900s people believed it was the end of the Internet, in the toughest times like this we need someone to hold up the walls. DONGE is designed as the catalyst for the blockchain adoption and experiments.

  We all see how a community can bring a project from the journey of SHIBA INU or DOGE. We realised that the true power doesn't come from a single perspective, it comes from working together in harmony. At the Donkey project we aim to build a fully decentralised community driven ecosystem powered by Internet Computer..
